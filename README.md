# SMILE: Simulator for Maryland Imitation Learning Environment #

SMILE is a simulated environment for studying robot imitation learning based on the hypothesis that, in many situations, procedural tasks can be learned more effectively by observing object behaviors while completely ignoring the demonstratorâ€™s motions. In other words, the demonstrator in the environment is intentionally made invisible to the robot learner. 

Primary features:

* Recording demonstrations of procedural tasks using mouse inputs and GUI. A recorded demonstration consists of a sequence of images (a "video") and accompanying text log. In a recorded demonstration, objects appear to move on their own, since the demonstrator is intentionally made invisible.
* Programming behaviors of a simulated robot in the environment via a simple Matlab API.
* Creating various simulated objects and controls for custom task scenarios using XML.
